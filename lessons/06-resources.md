## Resources for R

In this Intro to R workshop we have only scratched the surface. We have shown you some of the basic functions that can be useful for working with data of any kind. With a cornucopia of R packages and tools, the sky is the limit  in terms of what you can do with R!

We have a few useful resources listed here, if this has sparked enough interest for you to explore some more:

* Free online course: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
* Software Carpentry materials: http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/
* Data Carpentry materials: http://tracykteal.github.io/R-genomics/
* Materials from IQSS at Harvard: http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/Rintro.html
* [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/): learn R interactively from within the R console
* The free "try R" class from [Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com)
* HarvardX course ["Statistics and R for the Life Sciences"](https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/PH525.1x/1T2015/info)
* For advanced plottting: [ggplot reference site](http://docs.ggplot2.org/), and Winston Chang's excellent [Cookbook for R](http://wiki.stdout.org/rcookbook/Graphs/) site. Though slightly out of date, [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Anaysis](http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403) is still the definative book on this subject.
* RStudio keyboard shortcuts [cheatsheet:](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts)
