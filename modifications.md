## General Modifications
* Add a mention of lists to intro markdown; include the figure so students know what it is conceptually even though we are not using it
* Having figures/schematics for the selecting/subsetting sections
* Adding hyperlink to Resources markdown when there is mention of it in other lessons
* Take more time to discuss shortcuts in R; specifically running code from editor in console
* Add subset table for differnt data structures
* For basic plots, elaborate on `plot()` and talk about the differnt help options for adding aesthetics. Although not available for other base plots, the same rules generally apply


## Intro to R: Part I
* More detail on reading in data files; and exporting data
* Remove `match` function
* Keep only the layer-by-layer demonstration of `ggplot` scatterplot; add a schematic at the end to show layers and other options for layers


## Advanced R: Part II
* Move the additional ggplots here
* Move `match` here
* Add lists back in; including how to subset lists
* Add the `%in%` operator
