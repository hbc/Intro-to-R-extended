# Intro-to-R Extended

These materials are used to introduce participants to the R programming environment.

To get started take a look at the middle panel (under the red bar) of the main screen for this repo. You will find on the right hand side a button that allows you to 'Download ZIP'. You will need to click on that and a zip file 'Intro-to-R-master.zip' will be dowloaded to your computer, keep note of it's location. These are the materials required for this workshop.
